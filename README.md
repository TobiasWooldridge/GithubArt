# Github Art

This very simply script runs in a daily cron-job and makes commits to git and pushes them to github to draw artwork on
my activity graph, looking like the following:


     MMMMM  MMM   MMMM   M  MMMM  MMMM  
       M   M   M  M   M  M  M  M  M     
       M   M   M  MMMM   M  MMMM  MMMM  
       M   M   M  M   M  M  M  M     M  
       M    MMM   MMMM   M  M  M  MMMM  


Copy/paste/modify it. Do whatever you want with it. There's no need to reference me or anything.
